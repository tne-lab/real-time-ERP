/*
* The purpose of AtomicSynchronizer is to allow one "writer" thread to continally
* update some arbitrary piece of information and one "reader" thread to retrieve
* the latest version of that information that has been "pushed" by the writer,
* without either thread having to wait to acquire a mutex or allocate memory
* on the heap (aside from internal allocations depending on the data structure used).
* For one reader and one writer, this requires three instances of whatever data type is
* being shared to be allocated upfront. During operation, "pushing" from the writer and
* "pulling" to the reader are accomplished by exchanging atomic indices between slots
* indicating what each instance is to be used for, rather than any actual copying or allocation.
*
* There are two interfaces to choose from:
*
*  - In most cases, the AtomicSynchronizer logic can be wrapped together with data
*    allocation and lifetime management by using the AtomicallyShared<T> class template.
*    Here, T is the type of data that needs to be exchanged.
*
*      * The constructor for an AtomicallyShared<T> simply takes whatever arguments
*        would be used to construct each T object and constructs 3 copies. (If a constructor
*        with move semantics would be used, this is called for one of the 3 copies, and the
*        other 2 use copying constructors instead.)
*
*      * Any configuration that applies to all 3 copies can by done by calling the "apply" method
*        with a function pointer or lambda, as long as there are no active readers or writers.
*
*      * To write, construct an AtomicScopedWritePtr<T> with the AtomicallyShared<T>&
*        as an argument. This can be used as a normal pointer. It can be acquired, written to,
*        and released multiple times and will keep referring to the same instance until the
*        pushUpdate() method is called, at which point this instance is released for reading
*        and a new one is acquired for writing (which might need to be cleared/reset first).
*
*      * To read, construct an AtomicScopedReadPtr<T> with the AtomicallyShared<T>& as
*        an argument. This can be used as a normal pointer, and if you want to get the
*        latest update from the writer without destroying the read ptr and constructing
*        a new one, you can call the pullUpdate() method.
*
*      * If you attempt to create two write pointers to the same AtomicallyShared object, the
*        second one will be effectively null; you can check for this with the isValid() method
*        (if isValid() ever returns false, this should be considered a bug). The same is true
*        of read pointers, except that a read pointer acquired before any writes have occurred
*        is also invalid (since there's nothing to read), so the isValid() check is necessary
*        even if you know for sure there is only ever one read pointer at once.
*
*      * The hasUpdate() method on an AtomicallyShared<T> returns true if there is new data
*        from the writer that has not been read yet. After a call to hasUpdate() returns
*        true, the next constructed read ptr (if none currently exist) or current read ptr
*        after a subsequent call to pullUpdate() is guaranteed to be valid.
*
*      * The reset() method brings you back to the state where no writes have been performed yet.
*        Must be called when no read or write pointers exist.
*
*  - Using an AtomicSynchronizer directly works similarly; the main difference is that you
*    are responsible for allocating and accessing the data, and the AtomicSynchronizer just
*    tells you which index to use (0, 1, or 2) as the reader or writer.
*
*      * To write, use an AtomiSynchronizer::ScopedWriteIndex instead of an AtomicScopedWritePtr.
*        This can be converted to int to use directly as an index, and has a pushUpdate() method
*        that works the same way as for the write pointer. The index can be -1 if you try to
*        create two write indices to the same synchronizer.
*
*      * To read, use an AtomicSynchronizer::ScopedReadIndex instead of an AtomicScopedReadPtr.
*        This works how you would expect and also has a pullUpdate() method. Remember to check
*        whether it is valid before using if you're not using hasUpdate().
*
*      * AtomicSynchronizer has hasUpdate() and reset() methods as well.
*
*      * ScopedLockout is just a try-lock for both readers and writers; it will be "valid"
*        iff no read or write indices exist at the point of construction. By constructing
*        one of these and proceeding only if it is valid, you can make changes to each data
*        instance outside of the reader/writer framework (instead of AtomicallyShared<T>::apply).
